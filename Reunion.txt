Ideas: 

Tom goes to a different city and is starting to talk about it, showing off locations, as well as some residents [ these residents don't have to be normal tom bloke actors and can be friends and others related to the cast and crew.
While in the city Tom gets a phone call from a hospital, and is told that Jean Baptise is in the hospital after a heart attack.
Tom drives back to Saint Paul Michigan to meet Jean Baptise in the hospital. He meets dimarco there, and then goes into see jean, who is almost dead. he says some weak words to Tom ( kinda like an uncle ben speach)
Dimarco invites Tom back to his home so that Tom has a place to stay for the night, but Tom respectfully declines


Bit idea: Tom Bloke Can't Drive, so has to get a uber, and uber learned to drive via youtube tutorials.
